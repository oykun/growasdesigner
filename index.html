			<p>20+ Human Skills to grow your value as a designer and earn a  6+ figure income without sacrificing your life to design software or losing your job to AI Tools.</p>
			<p>&#9985;</p>
			<p>Dear Designer</p>
			<p>Figma, Framer, etc skills will get you so far in your design career, especially in this day and age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)!<p>
			<p>These days, there are a ton of designers who know how to use design software. With all the free videos and courses available online, it's become easier than ever to pick up these skills. Plus, with the advancement of AI, we are witnessing how rapidly AI is already replacing technical work (icon design, defining typographic scale, etc.)
			What is it then if it is not the technical design skills?</p>
			<p>I do not deny the importance of hard skills here, there are countless resources out there that can teach you how to use Figma, Framer, etc. I encourage you to take advantage of them. After all, being able to bring your vision to life with the right tools is a crucial part of the design process. it's also essential to appreciate the process itself and understand how each step contributes to the final outcome. Either via designing it directly or making use of AI tools.</p>
			<p>Mastering hard skills is important, but it's not enough if you want to succeed in the design world.</p>
			<p>To be relevant in the day and age of AI, earn a high income, stand out, and work on dream projects with ideal clients, you'll need to develop your human skills such as communication, creativity, leadership, problem-solving, empathy and more. These are all essential skills for success as a designer.</p>
			<p>By investing in these skills, you'll be better equipped to collaborate, communicate, and create designs that truly resonate. You will be the designer who benefits from AI advancement and grow instead of living in fear of being replaced by an AI tool.</p>
